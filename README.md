# Guidelines for Contributors:
Fodome is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. However, in order to maintain a healthy and productive environment, we ask all contributors to follow these guidelines:

Respect other contributors: Fodome is a collaborative effort, and we ask all contributors to be respectful and professional in their interactions with others. Personal attacks, harassment, or any other form of unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated.

You don't need permission to start working on an issue: If you find an issue that you would like to work on, you can simply comment on the issue to let us know that you are working on it. This will help us avoid having multiple contributors working on the same issue at the same time. However, we ask that you can start working on an issue even you have been not assigned to it.

Create a Github page for your forked repository: If you are working on a fork of the Fodome repository, we encourage you to create a Github page for your forked repository and include the link in your pull request. This will help us review your changes more easily and provide feedback.

We welcome contributors to open issues: If you have identified a bug or have a feature request, we welcome you to open an issue in the Fodome repository. However, we ask that you first search the existing issues to ensure that your issue has not already been reported. When opening an issue, please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, and any relevant error messages.

By following these guidelines, we hope to maintain a positive and productive environment for all contributors to the Fodome project.
